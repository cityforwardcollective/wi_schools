## Description

The `schools` table is perhaps the most useful table in the `wisconsink12` database because it pulls data from several different publicly available reports and a incorporates a few custom business rules to categorize schools in a meaningful way that facilitates analysis.

## Dictionary

The table below contains the data dictionary for the `schools` table.  This dictionary is also provided in CSV form in this folder ([raw here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityforwardcollective/wi_schools/master/data_dictionaries/schools/schools_data_dictionary.csv)).

```{r schools_dictionary}
dict <- read_csv("schools_data_dictionary.csv")

dict %>%
  kable(booktabs = T)
